Project Title: React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description:
------------------------------------------
Welcome to my React Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React, where two players can take turns to play the game on a 3x3 grid.

About the Game:
------------------------------------------
The React Tic-Tac-Toe game is a web-based version of the well-known Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses game. It provides a fun and interactive experience for users to challenge their friends or play against the computer.

Key Features:
------------------------------------------
- Interactive Gameplay: Players can click on the squares to make their moves, and the game will automatically determine the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.

- Player Turn Indication: The game displays whose turn it is (X or O) and updates the status message to indicate the current player's turn.

- Winner Declaration: When a player wins the game by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marks, the game announces the winner.

- Draw Detection: If no player wins and all squares are filled, the game declares a draw.

- Reset Button: Players can reset the game board at any time to start a new game.

Tech Stack:
------------------------------------------
The game is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses state management to handle game logic and UI updates. CSS styles are applied to enhance the appearance and provide a responsive layout.
